## Lambda Expression Workshop


### Setting up the workshop
The project was created using java 17, any newer version can also be used.

The project uses JUnit to test the problems.
To keep the project simple we aren't using a full build system like Gradle.
In order to add JUnit you will need to use your IDE's build system:
- [Intellij](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/junit.html#intellij)

### University courses and students
