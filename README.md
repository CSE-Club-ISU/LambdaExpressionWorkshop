## Lambda Expression Workshop


### Setting up the workshop
The project was created using java 17, any newer version can also be used.

The project uses JUnit to test the problems. 
Most IDEs should be able to run the tests without actually building the JAR file.

### University courses and students
The theme of the workshop is a university that has courses and students.

Take a look at the `src/main/java/University.java` file, this is where most of the information is stored.

The tasks to complete are in the `src/main/java/Tasks.java` file.
